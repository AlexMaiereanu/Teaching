\begin{problem}{Goto fail}{10}
Consider the `goto fail' example from the lecture notes.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Transcribe the faulty function (including the fault) as closely as possible in some programming language.
Because we will use testing and code analysis tools, it is good to use a language for which many tools exists, e.g., C or Java.

Replace all types, functions, and variables that are declared outside the code snippet with arbitrary implementations.
The only thing you have to ensure is that all three function calls in the body can succeed or fail independently.

\item Write a unit test for your function.
The test cases should be such that running your tests executes every line of the tested unit at least once.

\item Setup a code coverage library/tool and use it with your program.
Run the tests and see if every line is executed.
That should detect the fault.

\item Setup a static code analysis tool and run it on your program.
This should be such an unreachable-code-analysis detects the fault.

\item Setup a code style checker (e.g., as part of your IDE).
Configure it such that irregular indentation is flagged and the fault is detected.
\end{enumerate}
