\section{Common Structure}\label{sec:sd:typetheory:common}
% polymorphism?

Formal systems such as type theories, logics, and programming languages share the same basic structure.

\subsection{Objects}

The objects of a formal system consist of \textbf{syntax} and \textbf{meta-syntax}\footnote{There is no standard word for this. So I made up \emph{meta-syntax}, which describes it best.}.

\subsubsection{Context-Free Syntax}

The syntax consists of
\begin{compactitem}
 \item Concepts. This is a finite set of primitive concepts that defines the different kinds of objects that exist in the formal system.\\
 Examples are \emph{type}, \emph{term}, \emph{formula}, \emph{program}, or \emph{proof}.
 \item Constructors. This is a finite set of primitive operations that build objects. Each object is an instance of one of the concepts.\\
 Examples are
   \begin{compactitem}
    \item $\Int$ builds the type of integers.
    \item $\times$ takes two types and returns their product type.
    \item $==$ takes two terms and returns a formula.
   \end{compactitem}
\end{compactitem}
The concepts and constructors together form a \textbf{context-free} grammar by using
\begin{compactitem}
 \item one non-terminal for every concept
 \item one production for every constructor
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{Context-Sensitive Meta-Syntax}

The meta-syntax consists of
\begin{compactitem}
 \item Judgments. This is a finite set of possible statements we can make about the syntax.\\
 Judgments are usually written using the $\der$ symbol.\\
 Examples are
  \begin{compactitem}
   \item ``term $t$ is well-formed and has type $A$'', which we usually write as $\oftype{}{}{t}{A}$.
   \item ``formula $F$ is well-formed'', which we usually write as $\oftype{}{}{F}{\form}$.
   \item ``formula $F$ is provable'', which we usually write as $\istrue{}{}{F}$.
  \end{compactitem}
 A judgment may hold/be true/be derivable or not.
 \item Rules. This is a finite set of possible ways to derive judgments. Only the judgments that can be derived by using the rules are true.\\
 Rules are usually written using a horizontal line between assumption/premise/hypothesis judgments and conclusion judgment.
  Examples are
  \begin{compactitem}
   \item the modus ponens rule ``if $\istrue{}{}{F\impl G}$ and $\istrue{}{}{F}$, then $\istrue{}{}{G}$'', which we usually write as
   \[\rul{\istrue{}{}{F\impl G} \tb \istrue{}{}{F}}{\istrue{}{}{G}}\]
   \item the pairing rule ``if $\oftype{}{}{s}{A}$ and $\oftype{}{}{t}{B}$, then $\oftype{}{}{(s,t)}{A\times B}$'', which we usually write as
   \[\rul{\oftype{}{}{s}{A} \tb \oftype{}{}{t}{B}}{\oftype{}{}{(s,t)}{A\times B}}\]
   \item the integer axiom ``all elements of the regular expression $[-](0|\ldots|9)^*$ are integers'', which we might write as
   \[\rul{x \in [-](0|\ldots|9)^*}{\oftype{}{}{x}{\Int}}\]
   (This rule uses an assumption that is not a formal judgment. That is allowed if the assumption can be checked in a well-defined way.)
 \end{compactitem}
\end{compactitem}
Judgments are rules together form an \textbf{inference system}.
 
The choice of concepts, constructors, judgments, and rules is not prescribed.
Every system is free to choose.
However, for every object $O$ there must be one distinguished judgment, that checks whether $O$ is a well-formed object.
Typically, there is a separate way to determine well-formedness depending on the concept of which $O$ is an instance.
Examples are:
\begin{compactitem}
 \item The judgment $\oftype{}{}{F}{\form}$ directly captures the well-formed formulas.
 \item For a term $t$ to be well-formed, we usually require that the judgment $\oftype{}{}{t}{A}$ holds for some type $A$, i.e., a term is well-formed if it is well-typed.
\end{compactitem}

The syntax and the meta-syntax together form a \textbf{context-sensitive} sublanguage of the context-free syntax.
This sublanguage consists of all objects of the context-free language for which the well-formedness judgment holds.

\subsection{Declarations}

\subsubsection{Introducing Declarations}

While objects are always anonymous, the declarations of a formal system introduce \textbf{names} for objects.
Like objects, the declarations are defined by a grammar and inference system.

Typically, there is a fixed non-terminal $Decl$ and a fixed judgment $\isdecl{}{D}$ for declarations $D$.
The each declaration-kind is defined by one production and one rule.

Examples are
\begin{compactitem}
 \item Variable definitions are the declarations that introduce a name for a term. They consist of the production
  \[Decl ::= \aval{x}{A}{t}\]
  for a new variable $n$ of type $A$ with initial value $t$
  and the rule
  \[\rul{\oftype{}{}{t}{A}}{\isdecl{}{}{\aval{n}{A}{t}}}\]
  that checks that the initial value has the expected type.
\end{compactitem}
To make parsing easier, many languages (e.g., SML or Scala) require each declaration-kind to start with a special keyword (like $\akey{val}$ above).

We need to be able to use the names as objects later on.
Therefore, every concept comes with a built-in production for names.
For example, for terms we expect a production $term::=x$ where $x$ is the name of a variable.

Now \textbf{scope-checking} is the part of the inference system that ensures that a name $x$ may only be used if it has been previously declared.
That shows us that we cannot simply use the judgment $\oftype{}{}{x}{A}$---there would be no way to look up if $x$ has been declared.
Therefore, we have to collect all declarations that are in scope and carry them around.
That is the purpose of signatures and contexts.


\subsubsection{Collecting Declarations}

A \textbf{context} $\Gamma$ is a list of declarations.

Often we distinguish two kinds of declarations:
\begin{compactitem}
 \item The \textbf{global} declarations are the entire input (source file, program, etc.) that we are checking.
 It is fixed during checking.
 \item The \textbf{local} declarations are introduced temporarily while checking certain declarations.
 Examples are the parameters of a functions or variables declared inside a function.
\end{compactitem}

Usually all judgments for objects take a context as an additional argument.
It is usually placed to the left of the $\der$ symbol.
For example, we have $\oftype{}{\Gamma}{t}{A}$ or $\oftype{}{\Gamma}{F}{\form}$.
\medskip

Now the simplest form of scope-checking uses the rule
\[\rul{\aval{x}{A}{\_}\in \Gamma}{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{x}{A}}\]

And when checking input consisting of global declarations $D_1,\ldots,D_n$, we check for each $i=1,\ldots,n$ that $\isdecl{}{D_1,\ldots,D_{i-1}}{D_i}$.
Thus, each declaration is checked in the context of the previous ones.
\medskip

This simple checking is not always sufficient.
There are many situations that require more complex treatment.
Examples are
\begin{compactitem}
 \item Each declaration should introduce a fresh name. Otherwise, the later declaration shadows the previous one.
 \item A list of mutually recursive functions cannot be checked in order because all functions must be in the context already when the first function is checked.
 \item Some declarations may contain local declarations inside them. For example, a function declaration may contain local variable declarations.
 \item Some declarations may only be allowed globally (e.g., class definitions in some programming languages) or only locally (e.g., undefined variables to represent the parameters of a function).
\end{compactitem}

\subsection{A Basic Type Theory}

We now introduce a comprehensive example that we will build on later.
We first introduce an empty type theory, i.e., a type theory that has all the structure but non non-trivial objects yet.
We can then extend it with specific types and terms in Sect.~\ref{sec:sd:typetheory:objects}

The concepts and constructors are given by the following context-free grammar:

\begin{commgrammar}
\gcomment{declarations}\\
\gprod{Decl}{\atypedef{a}{A}}{type definition}\\
\galtprod{\aval{x}{A}{t}}{term definition}\\
\gcomment{types}\\
\gprod{A}{a}{type names}\\
\gcomment{terms}\\
\gprod{t}{x}{term names}
\end{commgrammar}

The judgments are:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
	  \hline
		$\oftype{}{\Gamma}{A}{\type}$ & $A$ is a well-formed type in context $\Gamma$ \\
		$\oftype{}{\Gamma}{t}{A}$     & $t$ is a well-formed term of type $A$ type in context $\Gamma$ \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

We only need the simple rules for scope-checking:
\[\rul{\atypedef{a}{A}\in \Gamma}{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{a}{\type}}\]
\[\rul{\aval{x}{A}{\_}\in \Gamma}{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{x}{A}}\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Concrete Objects}\label{sec:sd:typetheory:objects}

\subsection{Base Types}

\subsubsection{Types}

Base types $b$ are just names that are always in scope.
They are very easy to add using one production and one rule:

\[A \bbc b\]

\[\rul{}{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{b}{\type}}\]

Typical base types $b$ that we often add are
\begin{compactitem}
 \item $b=\Void$: the empty type
 \item $b=\Unit$: the unit type with one element
 \item $b=\Bool$: booleans
 \item $b=\Int$: integers
 \item $b=\String$: strings
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{Terms of Base Types: Base Terms}

Each base type $b$ comes with special base terms, often called literals that are defined by a regular expression $R_b$.

They are also easy to add using one production and one rule:

\[t \bbc R_b\]

\[\rul{l\in R_b}{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{l}{b}}\]

Typical literals are
\begin{compactitem}
 \item $R_\Void$= $\es$ (no literals for the empty type)
 \item $R_\Unit=()$ (the unique term of the unit type)
 \item $R_\Bool=\true|\false$
 \item $R_\Int=[-](0|\ldots|9)^*$
 \item $R_\String=(\backslash\backslash | \backslash" | "[^\backslash"])^*"$ (quoted string with $\backslash$ and " escaped)
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection{Terms Formed From Base Terms}

Each base type $b$ comes with special operators that allow working with a term $t:b$.

We need no operations for $\Void$ and $\Unit$.

For booleans, we can use the if-then-else constructor:
\[t \bbc \aifelseI{t}{t}{t}\]
\[\rul{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{c}{\Bool}\tb \oftype{}{\Gamma}{s}{A}\tb \oftype{}{\Gamma}{t}{A}}{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{\aifelseI{c}{s}{t}}{A}}\]

For integers, we need the arithmetic operations such as
\[t \bbc t+t\]
\[\rul{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{s}{\Int}\tb \oftype{}{\Gamma}{t}{\Int}}{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{s+t}{\Int}}\]

We omit the other operations on integers and strings.

\subsection{Product Types}

Product types add the Cartesian product.

Like for base types, the definition consists of three parts.

\subsubsection{Product Type}

The first part introduces the new type:

\[A \bbc A\times A\]
\[\rul{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{A}{\type}\tb \oftype{}{\Gamma}{B}{\type}}{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{A\times B}{\type}}\]

\subsubsection{Terms of Product Type: Pairs}

The second part introduces terms of the new type:

\[t \bbc (t,t)\]
\[\rul{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{s}{A}\tb \oftype{}{\Gamma}{t}{B}}{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{(s,t)}{A\times B}}\]

\subsubsection{Terms Formed From Pairs: Projections}

The third part introduces terms formed from a term $t:A\times B$ of the new type:

\[t \bbc t.1 \bnfalt t.2\]

\[\rul{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{t}{A\times B}}{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{t.1}{A}}
\tb\tb
 \rul{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{t}{A\times B}}{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{t.2}{B}}\]

\subsection{Function Types}

The most important type constructor in computer science is the one for function types---it is critical to implement computations.
It can be introduced systematically in the same way as products.

\subsubsection{Function Type}

The first part introduces the new type:

\[A \bbc A\to A\]
\[\rul{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{A}{\type}\tb \oftype{}{\Gamma}{B}{\type}}{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{A\to B}{\type}}\]

\subsubsection{Terms of Function Type: Anonymous Functions}

The second part introduces terms of the new type:

\[t \bbc \alam[A]{x}{t}\]
\[\rul{\oftype{}{\Gamma,x:A}{t}{A}}{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{\alam[A]{x}{t}}{A\to B}}\]

Terms of function type are the $\lambda$-abstractions $\lambda x:A.t$.
In programming languages we usually write something like $\alam[A]{x}{t}$ instead.
The meaning is the same.

$\lambda$-abstractions are more difficult than most other terms because they introduce a local variable.
This is no problem at all if we have understood type theory properly: we can simply add the local variable to the context while checking the term $t$.
\medskip

However, many programming languages and programmers are confused or overwhelmed by this.
Therefore, they often do not use anonymous functions.

Instead, they introduce a special declaration for named functions:
\[Decl \bbc \afunI[B]{f}{x:A}{t}\]

Using anonymous functions, that is just a special case of a definition:
\[\afunI[B]{f}{x:A}{t} \tb\text{is}\tb \aval{f}{A\to B}{\alam[A]{x}{t}}\]

However, named functions come up so often and are so convenient that most languages allow them even if they are redundant.

\subsubsection{Terms Formed From Functions: Function Applications}

The third part introduces terms formed from a term $t:A\to B$ of the new type:

\[t \bbc t(t)\]

\[\rul{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{s}{A\to B}\tb \oftype{}{\Gamma}{t}{A}}{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{s(t)}{B}}\]

\section{Data Types}

Software is most dependable if programs mimic the domain knowledge as closely as possible.
That requires being able to define new types capturing exactly the concepts of the domain.
The terms of these new types should capture exactly the needed domain data.

Data types are always named, i.e., they are introduced by declarations not by objects.
Like base, product, and function types, \emph{each} inductive data type declaration introduces $3$ kinds of objects.

Most programming languages allow defining data types.
But they may differ substantially in how they do it.

\subsection{Inductive Data Types}

An inductive data type is defined by a context-free grammar with a single non-terminal symbol.
It uses one term constructor for every production of the grammar such that its terms capture exactly the words of the grammar.
The operation on its terms is pattern-matching.

We usually want to work with arbitrary context-free grammars.
That is possible by using a set of mutually recursive inductive data types---one for each non-terminal.

\subsubsection{Type Declaration}

The declaration of an inductive data type looks as follows:

\[Decl \bbc \adata{a}{Con,\ldots,Con}\]
\[Con \bbc c(A,\ldots,A)\]
\[a,c \bbc \text{name} \]

\[\rul{\adata{a}{\ldots}\in\Gamma}{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{a}{\type}}\]

Given $\adata{a}{Con_1,\ldots,Con_n}$, $a$ is the \textbf{name} of the data type and each $Con_i$ is a \textbf{constructor}.
For a constructor $c(A_1,\ldots,A_n)$, $c$ is the name of the constructor and the $A_i$ are its \textbf{argument types}.

%In some programming language, each argument is of the form $s_i:A_i$ for a name $s_i$.
%The $s_i$ are called \textbf{selectors}.

The correspondence between grammars and inductive data types is as follows:
\begin{ctabular}{|p{.5\textwidth}|l|}
\hline
Grammar & Inductive Data Type \\
\hline
start symbol & not needed \\
non-terminal $N$ & inductive data type declaration with name $N$\\
production $N::= T_0 N_0 T_1 \ldots T_{n-1} N_{n-1} T_n$ & constructor for $N$ with argument types $N_i$ \\
name for production (must be invented) & name of constructor \\
name for occurrence $N_i$ of non-terminal symbol in production (must be invented) & selector \\ 
terminal symbols $T_i$ in production & ignored \\
\hline
\end{ctabular}

\subsubsection{Terms of an Inductive Data Type}

The constructors form elements of the type $a$:

\[t \bbc c(t,\ldots,t)\]
\[\rul{\adata{a}{c_1(A_1),\ldots,c_n(A_n)}\tb\in\tb\Gamma \tb \oftype{}{\Gamma}{t}{A_i}}{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{c_i(t)}{a}}\]

Here, for simplicity, the typing rule only covers the case where every constructor takes exactly $1$ argument.
The general case works accordingly (or can be obtained by using a product type as the single argument type).

\subsubsection{Terms Formed From Terms of Inductive Data Type}

To operate on a term of an inductive type, we use \textbf{pattern-matching}.

\[t \bbc \amatchI{t}{Cas,\ldots,Cas}\]
\[Cas \bbc \acase{c(x_1,\ldots,x_n)}{t}\]

In $\amatchI{t}{Cas_1,\ldots,Cas_n}$, $t$ is the matched term and the $Cas_i$ are the \textbf{cases}.
In a case $\acase{c(x_1,\ldots,x_n)}{t}$, we call $c(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ the \textbf{pattern} where $c$ is a constructor name and the $x_i$ are variables.
$t$ is called the \textbf{body} of the case.

Finally, the typing rule is: 

\[\rul{\adata{a}{c_1(A_1),\ldots,c_n(A_n)}\tb\in\tb\Gamma \tb \oftype{}{\Gamma}{t}{a}\tb\oftype{}{\Gamma,x:A_1}{t_1}{B}\tb\ldots\tb\oftype{}{\Gamma,x:A_n}{t_n}{B}}
      {\oftype{}{\Gamma}{\amatchI{t}{\acase{c_1(x)}{t_1},\ldots,\acase{c_n(x)}{t_n}}}{B}}\]


\subsection{Abstract Data Types}

Inductive and abstract data types are dual to each other.

An inductive data type is defined bottom-up: the terms are exactly the words over some context-free grammar.
Thus, we know the terms exactly.
When we operate on a term on the other hand, we have to inspect all possible cases.

An abstract data type is defined top-down by its \emph{behavior}: any object that exhibits the required behavior is a term of the type.
Thus, we do not know what the terms are---instead, we have to implement the behavior in each case.
When we operate on a term on the other hand, we know exactly what we can do because each term has the same behavior.

\subsubsection{Type Declaration}

The declaration of an abstract data type looks as follows:

\[Decl \bbc \aclassAI{a}{s:A,\ldots,s:A}{}{Field,\ldots,Field}\]
\[Field \bbc f:A\]
\[a,f,s,x \bbc \text{name} \]

\[\rul{\aclassAI{a}{\ldots}{\ldots}\in\Gamma}{\oftype{}{\Gamma}{a}{\type}}\]

Given $\aclassAI{a}{x_1:A_1,\ldots,x_n:A_m}{}{Field_1,\ldots,Field_n}$, $a$ is the \textbf{name} of the data type and each $Field_i$ is a \textbf{field}.
The $x_i:A_i$ are called the \textbf{constructor arguments}.
For a field $f:A$, $f$ is the name of the field and $A$ its type.

\begin{remark}[Relation to Object-Orientation]
Object-oriented programming languages provide a very rich formalism for defining abstract data types.

Our variant here is a special case that arises if we make the following restrictions about classes:
\begin{compactitem}
 \item There is no inheritance.
 \item There is exactly one constructor.
 \item The constructor arguments are exactly the private variables of the class.
 \item All methods are public and abstract.
 \item When creating a new instance, all methods must be implemented.
\end{compactitem}
It is straightforward to relax these restrictions when defining practical languages.
\end{remark}

There is a correspondence between certain kinds of machines and abstract data types.
We do not spell out the formal details of the machines here and only sketch the correspondence informally:
\begin{ctabular}{|p{.5\textwidth}|l|}
\hline
Machine & Abstract Data Type \\
\hline
set of possible states & product $A_1\times \ldots \times A_n$ of constructor argument types\\
initial state & constructor arguments $(s_1,\ldots,s_n)$ \\
current state & current value of tuple $(s_1,\ldots,s_n)$ \\
$f$-transition (push button labeled $f$) & field $f$ of function type\\
possible inputs for transition $f$ & argument types of $f$\\
possible outputs of transition $f$ & return type of $f$\\
\hline
\end{ctabular}

\subsubsection{Terms of an Abstract Data Type: New Instance Creation}

Terms of an abstract data type $a$ are created using the \textbf{new} operator.
They are also called \textbf{instances} of $a$.

\[t \bbc \anewA{a}{t,\ldots,t}{Def,\ldots,Def}\]
\[Def \bbc x=t\]

In $\anewA{a}{t_1,\ldots,t_n}{Def_1,\ldots,Def_n}$, the $t_i$ are the \textbf{constructor arguments}, and the $Def_i$ are the \textbf{field definitions}.

Again, we state the typing rule only for a special case: we assume that the constructor takes exactly $1$ argument.
The general case works accordingly.

\[\rul{\aclassAI{a}{x:A}{}{f_1:A_1,\ldots,f_n:A_n}\tb\in\tb\Gamma\tb
       \oftype{}{\Gamma}{t}{A} \tb
       \oftype{}{\Gamma}{t_1}{A_1}\tb\ldots\tb\oftype{}{\Gamma}{t_n}{A_n}}
      {\oftype{}{\Gamma}{\anewA{a}{s}{f_1=t_1,\ldots,f_n=t_n}}{a}}\]


\subsubsection{Terms Formed From a Term of an Abstract Data Type: Field Access}

To operate on a term of an abstract data type, we access its fields:

\[t \bbc t.f\]

\[\rul{\aclassAI{a}{\ldots}{}{f_1:A_1,\ldots,f_n:A_n}\tb\in\tb\Gamma\tb
       \oftype{}{\Gamma}{t}{a}}
      {\oftype{}{\Gamma}{t.f_i}{A_i}}\]

\subsection{Inheritance}

Inheritance generalizes abstract data types in two ways:
\begin{compactitem}
 \item fields may have a definition; such fields are skipped when creating a new instance
 \item we can form a new data type by extending an existing one, which has the effect of copying over all its fields
\end{compactitem}

Both generalizations can be seen as a matter of convenience.
However, by fixing certain definitions in the extended class, we gain enormous power to fine-tune the desirable behavior of the instances.


\subsubsection{Inductive Data Types Via Classes}

Another advantage of inheritance is that we can mimic inductive data types.

The correspondence is as follows:
\begin{ctabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Inductive Data Type & Classes \\
\hline
type declaration & abstract class without constructor arguments or fields\\
constructor & concrete extension \\
constructor arguments & constructor arguments of concrete extension \\
constructor application & new instance \\
pattern-matching & combination of if-then-else and is-instance-of\\
\hline
\end{ctabular}

Thus, we can mimic the inductive type
\begin{acode}
\adata{a}{\ldots, {c_i(A_1,\ldots,A_n)},\ldots}
\end{acode}
as
\begin{acode}
\aclassA{a}{}{}{}\\
\vdots \\
\aclass{c_i}{x_1:A_1,\ldots,x_n:A_n}{a}{}\\
\vdots
\end{acode}

Constructing a term $c_i(t_1,\ldots,t_n)$ corresponds to $\anew{c_i}{t_1,\ldots,t_n}$.
Equality at $a$ must be implemented such that $x==y$ iff $x$ and $y$ are instances of the same class $c_i$ and created with equal constructor arguments.
Pattern-matching can be implemented as well.

\begin{remark}[Inheritance for Inductive Data Types]
Inheritance works exactly the same way for inductive data types: fields with definition are skipped when pattern-matching, and new types can reuse the set of constructors of an existing type.

However, this is not used in practice.\footnote{Possibly because no one has understood it clearly so far.}
\end{remark}
