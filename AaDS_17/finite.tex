\section{Specification}

\paragraph{Void}
The set $\Void$ contains no elements.

The set $\Void$ is rarely used.
However, it is usually nice to have when dealing with operations that never return.
For example, we can say that throwing an exception or terminating the program returns an element of $\Void$.

\paragraph{Unit}
The set $\Unit$ contains exactly one element, which we call $()$.

The set $\Unit$ is rarely used.
However, it is very nice to have when dealing with operations that do not have a particular return value: if an operation returns but returns no value, we say that it returns an element of $\Unit$.

For example, we assume that assignments, loop, and print statements return $\Unit$.
Many methods of mutable data structures also return $\Unit$.
For example, using $\Unit$, we can specify $insert$ for a mutable list from Sect.~\ref{sec:ad:list:spec} as $insert(x\in A^*,a\in A,n\in\N)\in\Unit$.

\paragraph{Booleans}
The set $\Bool$ contains exactly two elements, which we call $\true$ and $\false$.

\paragraph{Integers Modulo}
For $m>0$, the set $\Z_m$ consists of the elements $\{0,\ldots,m-1\}$.

\paragraph{Enumerations}
For fresh names $l_1,\ldots,l_n$, the set $\Enum\{l_1,\ldots,l_n\}$ has $n$ elements, called $l_1,\ldots,l_n$.

The names $l_i$ must be fresh.
That means they may not have been defined previously.
This is similar to how the name of a new function or class must be fresh.

Defining enumeration set defines new values, namely the $l_i$.

\section{Implementation}

\paragraph{Void}
Most programs do not need the type void.

\paragraph{Unit}
Some programming languages have a built-in type $\Unit$.
If not, we can easily define it as an enumeration.

\paragraph{Booleans}
Most programming languages have a built-in type $\Bool$.
If not, we can easily define it as an enumeration.

\paragraph{Integers}
Most programming languages do not offer $\Z_m$ for every $m$.

However, the base type $\Int$ may be the special case for $m=2^{32}$ or $m=2^{64}$.

If we need $\Z_m$ for a specific $m$, we usually work with $\Int$ and use the $\modop$ operation to ensure we remain inside $\Z_m$.

\paragraph{Enumerations}
Most programming languages allow defining enumeration types in some way.

For example, in SML:

\begin{lstlisting}
datatype answer = yes | no | maybe
\end{lstlisting}

Or in C:

\begin{lstlisting}
enum {yes, no, maybe} answer;
\end{lstlisting}
